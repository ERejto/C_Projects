⚙️ STAGE 1: C++ Performance Foundations
1. Memory Allocator (Mini malloc)
Prompt: Write a custom memory allocator that supports malloc, free, and basic realloc functionality.

🧠 Focus: Memory management, fragmentation, page alignment, performance profiling.

💡 Hints: Use mmap or sbrk; benchmark against malloc; try slab allocation.

2. Lock-Free Ring Buffer
Prompt: Build a lock-free circular buffer with multiple producer/consumer support.

🧠 Focus: Atomic operations, memory barriers, false sharing.

💡 Hints: Use std::atomic; study cache line padding and the ABA problem.

3. High-Precision Timer
Prompt: Implement a timer with nanosecond resolution and minimal overhead.

🧠 Focus: clock_gettime, TSC (Time Stamp Counter), syscall overhead.

💡 Hints: Compare perf of system calls vs. RDTSC; calibrate CPU frequency.

🚀 STAGE 2: Low-Latency Systems Design
4. Market Data Feed Handler (UDP Multicast Parser)
Prompt: Build a feed handler that receives and parses market data over UDP multicast (simulate if needed).

🧠 Focus: Packet loss handling, parsing efficiency, struct layout.

💡 Hints: Look into ITCH or OUCH protocols; use recvmsg(); minimize heap allocs.

5. Order Book Aggregator
Prompt: Construct a limit order book engine with best bid/ask and market depth aggregation.

🧠 Focus: STL vs custom containers, latency, CPU cache usage.

💡 Hints: Use std::map then optimize; investigate memory layout and branch prediction.

6. User-Space Network Stack (DPDK or PF_RING)
Prompt: Set up a minimal UDP/IP stack using DPDK or PF_RING.

🧠 Focus: Kernel bypass, polling vs interrupts, DMA.

💡 Hints: DPDK requires hugepages; measure latency with and without interrupts.

🔧 STAGE 3: Hardware Interaction & FPGA Prep
7. PCIe Device Simulator
Prompt: Write a software model simulating an FPGA PCIe device interface.

🧠 Focus: Memory-mapped IO, DMA buffers, register reads/writes.

💡 Hints: Mock the BAR space; simulate latency for reads/writes.

8. Software-to-Hardware FIFO Interface
Prompt: Build a FIFO interface in C++ that simulates writing to and reading from a real FPGA module.

🧠 Focus: Burst transfers, data coherency, synchronization.

💡 Hints: Include back-pressure mechanisms; mimic AXI-Stream or Avalon-ST protocols.

9. Hardware Timestamp Capture Interface
Prompt: Simulate an interface where software polls or reads a hardware-based timestamp source.

🧠 Focus: Timing precision, memory barriers, sync with FPGA-side logic.

💡 Hints: Implement with polling + interrupt variant; test with synthetic timestamps.

🧠 STAGE 4: Performance Engineering + Realism
10. Microsecond Matching Engine
Prompt: Build a minimal order matching engine in C++ targeting <10μs latency per match.

🧠 Focus: Deterministic performance, hot paths, branchless programming.

💡 Hints: Profile every branch and cache access; avoid heap allocation; align structs.

11. Trading Gateway Simulator
Prompt: Create a simulator that models order submission to and from a trading venue, over a custom binary protocol.

🧠 Focus: Serialization, protocol framing, real-time constraints.

💡 Hints: Fixed-size fields, endian-ness handling, CRC checks.

12. Integrate with Verilog Testbench
Prompt: Write a C++ test harness to drive a Verilog testbench via DPI-C or cocotb-style interfacing.

🧠 Focus: SW-HW simulation loop, synchronization, HDL integration.

💡 Hints: Start with Verilator or ModelSim + DPI; match cycle-accurate timing.

⚡ Bonus: Tools & Ecosystem Must-Learn
Latency Profiling: perf, Valgrind, Intel VTune, Flamegraphs.

CPU Architecture: Instruction pipelining, TLBs, branch prediction.

Network: TCP vs UDP, congestion, jitter.

FPGA Toolchains: Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, Verilator.
